                                <h5>Primary Objective:</h5>
                                <li>The primary objective of Apollo 11 was to complete a national goal set by President John F. Kennedy on May 25, 1961: perform a crewed lunar landing and return to Earth.</li>
                                <h5>Additional Objectives:</h5>
                                <li>scientific exploration by the lunar module</li>
                                <li>deployment of a television camera to transmit signals to Earth</li>
                                <li>deployment of a solar wind composition experiment, seismic experiment package and a Laser Ranging Retroreflector.</li>
                                <li>Gathering samples of lunar-surface materials for return to Earth.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This was to be the last Apollo mission to fly a "free-return" trajectory, which would enable a return to Earth with no engine firing.</p>

                            <h5>Mission Highlights:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Apollo 11 launched from Cape Kennedy on July 16, 1969, carrying Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin into an initial Earth-orbit of 114 by 116 miles.</li>
                                <li>An estimated 650 million people watched Armstrong's televised image and heard his voice describe the event as he took "...one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind" on July 20, 1969.</li>
                                <li>Two hours, 44 minutes and one-and-a-half revolutions after launch, the S-IVB stage reignited for a second burn of five minutes, 48 seconds, placing Apollo 11 into a translunar orbit.</li>
                                <li>The command and service module (CSM) Columbia separated from the stage, including the spacecraft-lunar module adapter (SLA) which contains the lunar module (LM) Eagle.</li>
                                <li>After transposition and jettisoning of the SLA panels on the S-IVB stage, the CSM docked with the LM.</li>
                                <li>The first color TV transmission to Earth from Apollo 11 occurred during the translunar coast of the CSM/LM.</li>
                                <li>On July 18, Armstrong and Aldrin put on their spacesuits and climbed through the docking tunnel from Columbia to Eagle to check out the LM, and to make the second TV transmission.</li>
                                <li>At about 75 hours, 50 minutes into the flight, a retrograde firing of the SPS for 357.5 seconds placed the spacecraft into an initial, elliptical-lunar orbit of 69 by 190 miles.</li>
                                <li>Another TV transmission was made, this time from the surface of the moon.</li>
                                <li>Later, a second burn of the SPS for 17 seconds placed the docked vehicles into a lunar orbit of 62 by 70.5 miles, which was calculated to change the orbit of the CSM piloted by Collins.</li>
                                <li>At 100 hours, 12 minutes into the flight, the Eagle undocked and separated from Columbia for visual inspection.</li>
                                <li>At 101 hours, 36 minutes, when the LM was behind the moon on its 13th orbit, the LM descent engine fired for 30 seconds to provide retrograde thrust and commence descent orbit insertion.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>            
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <div class="summary" style="width: 500px; height: 930px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
                            <ul>
                                <li>At 102 hours, 33 minutes, after Columbia and Eagle had reappeared from behind the moon and when the LM was about 300 miles uprange, powered descent initiation was performed with the descent engine firing for 756.3 seconds.</li>
                                <li>After eight minutes, the LM was at "high gate" about 26,000 feet above the surface and about five miles from the landing site.</li>
                                <li>Partially piloted manually by Armstrong, the Eagle landed in the Sea of Tranquility in Site 2 at 0 degrees, 41 minutes, 15 seconds north latitude and 23 degrees, 26 minutes east longitude.</li>
                                <li>At about 109 hours, 42 minutes after launch, Armstrong stepped onto the moon. About 20 minutes later, Aldrin followed him. Half an hour later, President Nixon spoke by telephone link with the astronauts.</li>
                                <li>Commemorative medallions bearing the names of the three Apollo 1 astronauts who lost their lives in a launch pad fire, and two cosmonauts who also died in accidents, were left on the moon's surface. A one-and-a-half inch silicon disk, containing micro miniaturized goodwill messages from 73 countries, and the names of congressional and NASA leaders, also stayed behind.</li>
                                <li>Armstrong and Aldrin gathered and verbally reported on the lunar surface samples.</li>
                                <li>Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours, 36 minutes on the moon's surface. After a rest period that included seven hours of sleep, the ascent stage engine fired at 124 hours, 22 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Docking with Columbia occurred on the CSM's 27th revolution at 128 hours, three minutes into the mission. Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the CSM with Collins.</li>
                                <li>Re-entry procedures were initiated July 24, 44 hours after leaving lunar orbit. The SM separated from the CM, which was re-oriented to a heat-shield-forward position. Parachute deployment occurred at 195 hours, 13 minutes. After a flight of 195 hours, 18 minutes, 35 seconds - about 36 minutes longer than planned - Apollo 11 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, 13 miles from the recovery ship USS Hornet. </li>
